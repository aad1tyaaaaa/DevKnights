## Components

| Path | Stack | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `extension/` | TypeScript, VS Code API, esbuild | Primary product. Finds and validates lockfiles, obtains consent, submits to the API, shows state in a TreeView. |
| `backend/` | Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic | Validates submissions; future home of parsing, graph building, detection, and verification. |
| `frontend/` | Next.js App Router, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui conventions, Lucide | Web dashboard for deeper investigation. |
| `contracts/` | Solidity, Hardhat 3, viem | Registry of approved release-manifest hashes. Local network only. |
| `demo/` | — | Sample project with a tiny lockfile for end-to-end checks. |

The monorepo does **not** use npm workspaces: each JS package has its own `node_modules` and lockfile, which keeps vsce packaging, Next.js, and Hardhat 3 (ESM) independent. The root `package.json` only holds convenience scripts. Python dependencies live in `backend/requirements.txt`.

## Trust boundaries and safety rules

- The extension reads `package-lock.json` with `vscode.workspace.fs` and never runs `npm`, package code, or lifecycle scripts.
- Nothing leaves the machine without a modal confirmation for each scan, naming the destination URL. Only the lockfile is sent.
- The backend treats lockfile content as untrusted data: size-capped body (checked while streaming), strict schema, no echo of input in errors.
- Error messages shown to users never include lockfile contents.
- Registry requests retrieve public metadata only, use bounded concurrency/timeouts/retries, and report failures as unavailable rather than inventing values.
- Blockchain results are evidence, not verdicts: a match is not proof of safety; no record is not proof of compromise.
- Release verification is read-only (`eth_call` over JSON-RPC): the backend holds no keys and never writes to the chain. Anchoring is a separate, owner-only step in `contracts/`.

## Persistence

Phase 3 stores submitted scan snapshots and completed graphs in SQLite through SQLAlchemy. The backend always loads `backend/.env`; configure it there with `PROVENYX_DATABASE_URL`. Its default `sqlite:///./provenyx.db` is anchored to the backend directory, so every launch method uses `backend/provenyx.db`. A production move to PostgreSQL still requires migrations before deployment.
