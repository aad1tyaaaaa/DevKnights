# Provenyx Security

**Trust Every Dependency. Verify Every Release.**

Provenyx helps JavaScript and TypeScript developers investigate npm dependencies recorded in local npm and pnpm lockfiles, without installing or running any of them.

> **Preview.** The extension needs a running Provenyx API (see [Requirements](#requirements)). After you confirm a scan, the API builds a dependency graph from your lockfile, reads public npm metadata, and runs explainable detection rules. Findings are investigation signals, not security verdicts. Provenyx never shows invented findings.

## Features

- **Provenyx: Scan Dependencies.** Finds every `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` across your workspace folders, checks each locally, and sends its dependency data to the Provenyx API after you confirm.
- **Findings sidebar.** Lists findings by severity, each with confidence, a plain-language explanation, and the dependency path that pulls the package into your project. Click a finding to investigate it in the web dashboard.
- **Scan status.** Shows the backend connection and the progress of your last scan.
- **Provenyx: Open Dashboard.** Opens the Provenyx web dashboard with the dependency graph, evidence, and release-record verification.
- **GitHub sign-in.** Uses VS Code's built-in GitHub authentication when the extension starts. Dashboard links carry the signed-in session into the browser, so no second website login is required.
- **Provenyx: Check Backend Connection.** Checks that the configured API is reachable.

Findings are leads to investigate, not proof of compromise. When a release matches a blockchain-anchored record, its metadata is unchanged, but that does not prove the package is safe. A release with no record is not suspicious in itself.

## Privacy and safety

- Provenyx **never installs, builds, or executes** packages from your project and never runs lifecycle scripts.
- Your lockfile is sent **only after you confirm** each scan, and only to the URL in `provenyx.apiBaseUrl`.
- Only dependency data from `package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml` is sent. No source files or project credentials are uploaded.
- VS Code securely stores the GitHub session. The extension sends its GitHub access token to the configured Provenyx API only for server-side validation and a short-lived, single-use dashboard handoff; the token is never placed in a URL or stored by the extension.
- On startup and before each scan, the extension calls the API's `/health` endpoint to show the connection state. This sends no project data.
- The extension collects no telemetry.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `provenyx.apiBaseUrl` | `https://devknights.onrender.com` | Provenyx API. Lockfiles are only sent here after confirmation. |
| `provenyx.dashboardUrl` | `https://provenyx.vercel.app` | URL opened by **Open Dashboard** and by clicking findings. |
| `provenyx.autoScanEnabled` | `true` | Scan supported lockfiles across all workspace folders when a project opens or a lockfile is created or changes. |

## Requirements

GitHub authentication in VS Code. The public extension uses the deployed Provenyx API and dashboard. To run those services locally instead, follow [the development guide](https://github.com/aad1tyaaaaa/DevKnights/blob/main/docs/development.md).
